# BootCSS

## Motivation

Without the JS part, Bootstrap is lovely. Since I prefer writing my own code to perform the UI logic. For god's sake, I think Bootstrap's UI styling can be even better, so let the hacking begin.

## No grid system

Grid system is an essential part of each UI library, but apparently it's out of the scope of this project. Its aim is to improve Bootstrap's UI styling.

You can choose whatever grid-system you like, if you are a fan of flexbox, use [grd](https://github.com/1000ch/grd) or [gridly](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/gridly), if you want to be more traditional, there are tons of options you can find from GitHub's search result.
